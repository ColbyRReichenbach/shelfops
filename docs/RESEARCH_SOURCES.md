# ShelfOps Research Sources (Reliable, Citation-Ready)

_Last updated: February 15, 2026_

## Purpose

This document captures reliable external research used to support ShelfOps context claims.
It separates:

- figures directly disclosed in company annual filings (highest reliability),
- industry-wide metrics from established retail organizations,
- claims that should **not** be made without stronger evidence.

## Method

1. Prioritize primary sources (SEC filings / official organization publications).  
2. Use exact filing language where possible.  
3. Avoid attributing industry-wide loss values to a specific company unless the company discloses it directly.

## Verified Company Metrics (SEC Filings)

### Target Corporation (Form 10-K, FY ended February 1, 2025)

Safe figures:

- Net sales: **$106.566B**, down **0.8%** YoY.
- Comparable sales: **+0.1%**.
- Comparable sales drivers: traffic **+1.4%**, average transaction amount **-1.3%**.
- Operating income margin rate: **5.2%** (vs 5.3% prior year).
- Inventory shrink sensitivity: a **10% change** in year-end shrink reserve would impact cost of sales by about **$150M**.

### Walmart Inc. (Form 10-K, FY ended January 31, 2025)

Safe figures:

- Net sales: **$674.538B**, up **5.0%** YoY.
- Walmart U.S. comparable sales (including fuel): **+4.8%**.
- Gross profit rate: **24.1%** (vs 23.7% prior year).
- Operating income margin: **4.4%** (vs 4.2% prior year).

Important note:

- Filing discusses theft/shrink risk, but does **not** disclose a single definitive shrink-dollar loss value in the same way some peers disclose reserve sensitivity.

- Total customer transactions: **809M** (vs 835M prior year).

## Verified Industry Metrics (Context, Not Company-Specific)

### National Retail Federation (NRF)

Safe figures:

- NRSS 2023 reports average shrink at **1.6%** (FY2022), up from 1.4% prior year.
- NRSS 2023 estimates total U.S. shrink losses at **$112.1B** (industry-level).
- NRF 2024/2025 theft-violence research indicates continued elevation in shoplifting incidents and violence during theft events.

- NRF theft/violence update: https://nrf.com/nrfcom/media-center/press-releases/new-study-finds-retailers-continue-to-contend-with-rising-levels-of-theft-and-violence

## Safe Claim Templates

Use these patterns in docs/pitches:

1. "Based on FY2024/2025 SEC filings, Target/Walmart/Lowe’s reported comp-sales changes of X/Y/Z, with explicit shrink sensitivity disclosures at Target and Lowe’s."
2. "Industry-wide retail shrink has been reported by NRF at 1.6% average and $112.1B total loss (NRSS 2023), which motivates better inventory controls."
3. "Company filings support elevated shrink as a financial risk; exact per-company loss attribution should only use each company’s own disclosed reserve/sensitivity values."

## Do Not Claim (Without New Evidence)

Do **not** state:

- "Target (or Walmart/Lowe’s) lost $X directly to ghost stock." (not directly disclosed in filings)
- "Walmart lost exactly $X to theft in FY2025." (not explicitly disclosed as a single value in the cited 10-K)
- "Industry shrink dollars are each company’s shrink dollars." (category error)

## Citation Use Rule

When adding new external numbers:

1. Add source URL.
2. Add source date/publication period.
3. Classify the claim as:
   - `company-disclosed`,
   - `industry-context`,
   - `hypothesis` (if not empirically disclosed).
