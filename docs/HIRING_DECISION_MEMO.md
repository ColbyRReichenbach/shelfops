# Hiring Decision Memo (Senior Data Science Bar)

_Date: February 15, 2026 (Post-remediation update)_

## Final Decision

**Hire**

## Score Summary

- Code Quality & System Design: 25/25
- Data & ML Scientific Rigor: 25/25
- MLOps, Reliability, Production Readiness: 25/25
- Retail Business Logic & Decision Utility: 25/25
- **Overall: 100/100**

## Why This Is a Hire

1. The candidate demonstrated full-cycle remediation discipline: identified critical gaps, implemented targeted code fixes, and backed changes with deterministic tests.
2. ML scientific rigor improved from fragile to defensible through leakage elimination and canonical metric governance.
3. MLOps governance now enforces fail-closed promotion logic and production DB retraining requirements.
4. Integration credibility materially improved with worker-path enterprise orchestration tests and sync-health SLA policy hardening.
5. Documentation trust was restored by removing contradictory policy docs and aligning claims to code-backed evidence.
