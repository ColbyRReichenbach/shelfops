ShelfOps is an inventory intelligence platform designed for SMB launch-candidate use with enterprise-style integration design.

## Capability Summary

- Demand forecasting and decision support: `implemented`
- Contract-driven onboarding for heterogeneous source schemas: `implemented`

Enterprise integration paths are in production code and validated in deterministic tests, but enterprise onboarding is not commercially available (non-GA).

## Why SMB-First

- Faster onboarding and tighter operational iteration loops: `implemented` strategy
- Lower dependency surface for first shipping workflows: `implemented` strategy
- Enterprise path retained as validation and architecture depth: `pilot_validated` positioning
