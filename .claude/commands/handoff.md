1. **Session Summary**: What was accomplished — bullet list of specific files changed
2. **Current State**: Which phase, what is working, what is broken or incomplete
3. **Decisions Made**: Architectural or implementation decisions with rationale
4. **Open Questions**: Unresolved issues or tradeoffs
5. **Next Steps**: Concrete next 3 actions with file paths where relevant
6. **Commands to Resume**: Exact commands needed to pick up where we left off
