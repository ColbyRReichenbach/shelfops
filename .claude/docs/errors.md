## How This Works

When Claude encounters an error during tool execution, it automatically logs:
1. **Error message**: The actual error
2. **Context**: What was being attempted
3. **Tool**: Which tool failed
4. **Timestamp**: When it occurred

After resolving, update the entry with:
- **Root cause**: Why it happened
- **Solution**: How it was fixed
- **Prevention**: How to avoid in future
